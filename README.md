# dotfiles

These dotfiles use [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to manage configuration and development environments, for both my personal MacOS system and my work Debian system.
I have also used NixOS in the past so there are instructions for that too.

Currently, my workflow revolves around a combination of [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html), [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).

- [24-bit-color.sh](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/scripts/24-bit-color.sh) - useful for testing colours in terminal setup.
- [Profile zsh startup time](https://esham.io/2018/02/zsh-profiling) - helped me figure out that `nvm` delayed my shell startup by 2 seconds.
