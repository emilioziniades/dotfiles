# dotfiles

## dotfiles for zsh, neovim and tmux

```
git clone https://github.com/emilioziniades/dotfiles && ./dotfiles/setup.sh
```


So this branch, `nixless` has become the thing I am switching back to after a rash decision to put everything onto home-manager. I think the aim should be to switch over slowly to nix, adding things one at a time. The first thing I think I will include is `git`, since it is a simple enough program and the Ubuntu 22.04 git is pretty old.

Eventually, I would like to merge this branch back into the main branch, retaining all the scripts for now.
